#Planty 

Hi! This is the code behind my take on a wellness/productivity app that I wanted to build out for my UXAB application.

Basis of app:
- Spoke with friends and family about what some big productivity blockers are for them, some were remembering tasks, feeling overwhelmed, too scared to start, and lacked motivation

- Planty allows users to develop their own goals of any category

- Provides users with visual interfaces that help track and encourage continuous progress toward that goal

- Encourages baby steps, small individual contributions that toward bigger picture

- Aimed for a clean, minimalistic UI, and for a really friendly and supportive user experience
